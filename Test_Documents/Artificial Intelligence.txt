Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding.

Key Areas of AI:
1. Machine Learning (ML) – Algorithms that learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
3. Computer Vision – Allows systems to interpret and process visual information from the world.
4. Robotics – Combines AI with mechanical engineering to create machines capable of performing complex actions.
5. Expert Systems – Programs designed to make decisions in real-world situations based on knowledge bases.

Applications of AI:
- Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Self-driving cars
- Fraud detection in finance
- Personalized recommendations on platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon
- Healthcare diagnostics and drug discovery

AI is rapidly evolving and continues to transform industries by enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making capabilities.
