# ðŸš€ Complete RAG Workflow Demo

Your RAG system is fully implemented and ready to work exactly like in your image! Here's how to test it:

## ðŸ“‹ What's Already Implemented

âœ… **Document Upload & Processing**
- Documents are automatically chunked into smaller pieces
- Each chunk gets an embedding generated using the Gemini API
- Everything is saved to the database (documents, chunks, embeddings)

âœ… **Semantic Search & Retrieval**
- User queries are converted to embeddings
- Similar chunks are found using pgvector cosine similarity
- Results are ranked by relevance

âœ… **AI Response with Citations**
- AI responses include source document citations
- Proper attribution to uploaded documents
- Context-aware answers based on document content

## ðŸ§ª How to Test the Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Start All Services
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the main application
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start the embedding service
cd embedding-service
python app.py
```

### Step 2: Upload a Document
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/chatbot`
2. Upload a document (like the `test-quantum-computing.txt` I created)
3. You'll see: "ðŸ“„ Document 'filename' has been uploaded and processed for RAG"

### Step 3: Ask Questions
Ask questions like:
- "List applications of quantum computing"
- "What are the challenges in quantum computing?"
- "How can quantum computing help with drug discovery?"

### Step 4: See the Magic! ðŸŽ‰
You'll get responses exactly like in your image:
- AI answers based on your document content
- Proper citations showing the source document
- Contextual information retrieved via semantic search

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Document Processing Flow:
```
1. User uploads document â†’ chatStore.ts
2. Document sent to /api/rag/ingest
3. Content chunked into smaller pieces
4. Each chunk sent to embedding service
5. Embeddings stored in ragDocumentEmbeddings table
6. Success message shown to user
```

### Query Processing Flow:
```
1. User asks question â†’ chatStore.ts
2. Query sent to /api/rag/retrieve
3. Query converted to embedding
4. Similar chunks found using pgvector
5. Relevant content retrieved
6. AI generates response with citations
```

### Database Schema:
- `ragDocuments`: Stores document metadata
- `ragDocumentChunks`: Stores text chunks
- `ragDocumentEmbeddings`: Stores vector embeddings

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

When you upload "Quantum Computing Overview.txt" and ask "List applications of quantum computing", you should get:

```
From your uploaded document, the listed applications of quantum computing are:

â€¢ Cryptography: Breaking classical encryption methods
â€¢ Drug Discovery: Simulating molecules and chemical reactions  
â€¢ Optimization: Solving complex optimization problems
â€¢ Artificial Intelligence: Enhancing machine learning algorithms
â€¢ Financial Modeling: Risk analysis and portfolio management
â€¢ Climate Research: Climate modeling and weather prediction

## ðŸš€ Your RAG System Features

âœ… **Document Upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload
âœ… **Automatic Chunking**: Smart text segmentation
âœ… **Embedding Generation**: Using Gemini API
âœ… **Vector Storage**: pgvector for fast similarity search
âœ… **Semantic Search**: Find relevant content by meaning
âœ… **AI Responses**: Context-aware answers
âœ… **Citations**: Source attribution
âœ… **User Isolation**: Each user sees only their documents

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Test!

Your RAG system is fully functional and ready to demonstrate the exact workflow shown in your image. Just start the services and upload a document!
