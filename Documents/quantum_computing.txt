Quantum Computing Basics

Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits. 
A qubit can represent both 0 and 1 at the same time through superposition. 
Entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in ways that classical bits cannot. 
Quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm can factorize large numbers efficiently, 
and Grover's algorithm can search unsorted databases faster than classical methods.

Important Fact for Testing:
The special phrase to remember is "Blue Tigers Fly at Midnight".
