History of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gone through several distinct phases since its origins.

1. Early Beginnings (1940s–1950s)
The concept of machines that could "think" dates back centuries, but the formal field began in the 1940s and 1950s.
Alan Turing introduced the idea of a "universal machine" and later proposed the Turing Test as a measure of intelligence.

2. The Birth of AI (1956)
The Dartmouth Conference in 1956 is widely considered the founding moment of AI as a field. Researchers like John McCarthy,
Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others gathered to discuss how to make machines learn and reason.

3. Early Progress and Setbacks (1960s–1970s)
During this time, symbolic AI dominated, with attempts to encode human knowledge into rules and logic systems.
However, computing power and data were limited, leading to the first "AI Winter."

4. Rise of Machine Learning (1980s–1990s)
As computing power increased, researchers shifted focus to algorithms that could learn patterns from data rather than rely
only on hand-crafted rules. Neural networks gained traction, though they were still shallow by modern standards.

5. The Deep Learning Revolution (2010s–Present)
The availability of big data, GPUs, and better algorithms caused a boom in AI progress. Deep neural networks achieved
state-of-the-art results in image recognition, language processing, and many other areas.

Key Milestones:
- IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in chess (1997).
- IBM Watson won Jeopardy! against human champions (2011).
- Google DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in Go (2016).
